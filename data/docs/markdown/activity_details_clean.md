# Activity Details

## Activity 1: Structured Problem-Solving on Implementation Barriers
### Step 2: Generate Challenges (10 mins)
- **Participant Action**: Discuss and write multiple challenges (one per slip/card). Aim for 5–7 concise items
- **Facilitator Action**: Circulate among groups, asking questions to guide the challenge generation
- **Materials**: 1. Blank challenge slips
2. Pen

### Step 3: Pass to another table (2 mins)
- **Participant Action**: 1. Seal slips in the envelope/box, pass to another table.
- **Facilitator Action**: nan
- **Materials**: 1. Small box

### Step 4: Synthesizing for Sharing (15 mins)
- **Participant Action**: 1. Rank the challenges using a quick rule (e.g., Impact × Feasibility or “Top 3 most blocking”)
2. For some of the top challenges, discuss & propose one solution and concrete steps tied to the CPS Components
- **Facilitator Action**: 1. Encourage groups to think creatively and practically
2. Remind them to focus on solutions within their control.
- **Materials**: 1. Difficulty Leaderboard
2. CPS prompt sheet

### Step 5: Whole-Group Share-Back (10 mins)
- **Participant Action**: Each group's representative shares their key takeaway with the larger group.
- **Facilitator Action**: To select five groups for stand-up sharing.

## Activity 2: Community Resource Mapping
### Step 2.0: Community Brainstorming & Mapping (10 mins)
- **Participant Action**: 1. Break into district groups
2. Brainstorm local spaces (parks, playgrounds, libraries, community centres, waterfronts)
3. Post each location as a new item on the Padlet map.
- **Facilitator Action**: 1. Circulate among groups, challenging them to look beyond standard playgrounds
2. Prompt to identify unique spaces e.g. rich in natural elements (water, sand, trees); allow for messy, adventurous play, directly addressing the common limitations of urban Hong Kong playscapes.

### Step 3.0: Analysis & Annotation (10 mins)
- **Participant Action**: 1. Using the "Legend" sheet, discuss and analyse each mapped location
2. Add comments to Padlet posts evaluating the space against the principles from the prompt sheet
- **Facilitator Action**: Prompt groups with targeted questions that reflect common coaching points, such as: "How could you use storytelling to make this space more relatable?" or "How can we empower parents to be play facilitators in this public space instead of just supervisors?
- **Materials**: 1. 'Legend' Sheet

### Step 4.0: Synthesis & Sharing Preparation (3 mins)
- **Participant Action**: 1. Review annotated map
2. Identify 1-2 key landmarks or surprising insight
3. Designate one group member to share this key takeaway in under 2 mins.
- **Facilitator Action**: Announce the transition to the sharing phase. Remind groups to be concise and focus on their most impactful finding.

### Step 5.0: Whole-Group Share-Back (15 mins)
- **Participant Action**: One representative from each group shares their key takeaway with the entire audience.
- **Facilitator Action**: Facilitate a brief wrap-up, actively listening for and highlighting common themes (e.g., a shared lack of spaces for water play) or innovative ideas (e.g., using a local waterfront for sensory activities) that emerged across districts.

To select five groups for stand-up sharing, each group should represent one district
